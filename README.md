# Solar Calculator

A prototype of a web app that calculates nominal power of a user defined hypothetical solar installation. This is a prototype/demo: please don't use it to make decisions about solar installations.

##USUAGE:
Clone the project and run 'npm install' to download all the necessary dependencies.

##BUILT WITH
(include links to each of these)

- Webpack: I chose Wepback because it allows 1. for the use of modules on the front-end 2. installing third party modules via NPM (fix this explanation). I also use webpack's dev server for ease of development
- Babel
- Mapbox: I chose Mapbox because it has 1. Clear documentation 2. Ability to draw a polygon and allow the user to search along with clear documentation and example on how to implement these features 3. I prefered Mapbox's user interface for drawing polygon's over Google Maps.
- Turf: Turf is a javascript library that provides geospatial analysis. I chose it because it was included in the Mapbox example. I only use (and installed) the area module to calculat area.
